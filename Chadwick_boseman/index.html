                <p style="color: rgb(7, 6, 9); font-size: 18px"><b>Chadwick Aaron Boseman was born and raised in Anderson, South Carolina,the son of Carolyn and Leroy Boseman, both African-American.His mother was a nurse, and his father worked at a textile factory and managed an upholstery business. In his youth, Boseman practiced martial arts, and continued this training as an adult. As a child, he wanted to become an architect.
                <br>
                <br>Boseman graduated from T. L. Hanna High School in 1995 where he played on the basketball team. He competed in Speech and Debate in the National Speech and Debate Association at T. L. Hanna. He placed eighth in Original Oratory at the 1995 National Tournament.
                <br>
                <br>His teachers at Howard included Al Freeman Jr. and Phylicia Rashad, who became a mentor. Rashad helped raise funds, notably from her friend and prominent actor Denzel Washington, so that Boseman and other classmates could attend the Oxford Summer Program of the British American Drama Academy at Balliol College, Oxford, in England to which they had been accepted. Boseman wanted to write and direct, and initially began studying acting to learn how to relate to actors. He attended the program in 1998, and developed an appreciation for the playwriting of William Shakespeare, studying the works of various dramatists including Samuel Beckett and Harold Pinter. He also traveled to Africa for the first time while at college, working in Ghana with his professor Mike Malone "to preserve and celebrate rituals with performances on a proscenium stage"; he said it was "one of the most significant learning experiences of [his] life". After he returned to the U.S., he took additional course work in film studies, graduating from New York City's Digital Film Academy.

                <p style="color: rgb(7, 6, 9); font-size: 18px"><b>In 2008, Boseman moved to Los Angeles to pursue his film and acting career. He was cast in a recurring role on the television series Lincoln Heights as Nathaniel Ray Taylor, an army veteran with PTSD who was later revealed to be the son of the main character before re-enlisting.
                <br>
                <br>Boseman's breakthrough role came in 2013 with the film 42, in which he portrayed the lead role of baseball legend Jackie Robinson.To replicate Robinson's mannerisms, Boseman trained for five months with professional baseball coaches who "would tape [his] practices every few weeks, and they would basically split-screen [his technique] with [Robinson's]" to allow him to compare. The same year, Boseman also starred in the independent film The Kill Hole, which was released in theaters a few weeks before 42.
                <br>
                <br>His performance was praised as the highlight of an also good movie, with the Rotten Tomatoes critical consensus reading: "With an unforgettable Chadwick Boseman in the starring role, Get On Up offers the Godfather of Soul a fittingly dynamic homage." Among the critics was Time's Richard Corliss (hyperbolically) saying that Boseman "deserves a Pulitzer, a Nobel and instant election to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame." Eulogizing Boseman, Donald Clarke of The Irish Times said that "Get on Up tested every weapon in the actor's arsenal [and his] performance confirmed that, like a star from Hollywood's golden age, Chadwick Boseman could do it all and do it all with style.
                <br>
                <br>Boseman had sold a thriller screenplay to Universal Pictures in 2014, which he continued to collaborate on with creative partner Logan Coles and planned to star in, and told The Guardian that he still wanted to be a director but would explore his acting career first, adding that "maybe it'll be easier if you're a successful actor". In 2016, he starred as Thoth, a deity from Egyptian mythology, in Gods of Egypt. drawn criticism for using a predominantly white cast to portray Egyptian characters.

                    Anyone who’s seen Ryan Coogler’s Black Panther, released in 2018, knows that the film’s powerful analogies are still timely in 2020, and likely will be for years to come.
                    <br>It was honored with an American Film Institute (AFI) Award, recognizing it as one of the 10 most significant achievements in film, and has been widely praised for its majority black cast and for addressing racism, colonialism and slavery.
                    <br>
                    <br>In 2013, he starred in The Lunchbox, which won the Grand Rail d'Or at Cannes Film Festival and received a BAFTA nomination, and became his highest-grossing Hindi film up until then.
                    <br>
                    <br>However, what many people don’t know is that leading man Chadwick Boseman, who headlines as T’Challa/Black Panther (an African king who moonlights as a crime-fighter) was 41 when he rose to fame. This was largely due to his role in Coogler’s Marvel-tinted universe.
                    <br>
                    <br>In a world of child stars and a race for early success, one might say Chadwick achieved fame rather late in life compared to his contemporaries. His story is one worth knowing because it can and should serve as an inspiration to people of any age, race, or background who happen to have big dreams.
                    <br>
                    <br>In 2018, he headlined Black Panther—and the rest is history. The movie became one of the highest-grossing films of the year in the US. In the following year, he reprised the role in both Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame, which were released in 2018 and 2019, both of which were the highest grossing films of the year. Fabulous fact: Endgame actually went on to become the highest-grossing film of all time!
                    <br>
                    <br>At the 47th AFI Life Achievement Award tribute in 2019, Chadwick gave a moving speech about Denzel Washington’s influence on Black Panther, with a teary eyed Washington (who was there to receive the award) in attendance.

                    <br>
                    <br>Boseman was raised a Christian and was baptized. He was part of a church choir and youth group and his former pastor said that he still kept his faith. He studied Hebrew and had a good knowledge of both the Old Testament and New Testament.

                    <br>Outside of performing, Boseman supported various charities. He worked with cancer charities including St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, continuing to support those battling the disease up until his own death from it; in a message to a producer days before he died, Boseman inquired about sending gifts to childhood cancer patients. He donated $10,000 to the Boys and Girls Club of Harlem to provide free tickets for children who wanted to see Black Panther; he did this to support and promote the Black Panther Challenge started by a New Yorker to raise money for similar children across the country. In response, Disney donated $1 million to the Boys & Girls Clubs to advance its STEM programs. Boseman advocated for children's charities, with the Jackie Robinson Foundation noting after his death that he helped with their youth outreach. When Disney planned to donate $400 million to charitable causes, Boseman encouraged the move. In April 2020, he donated $4.2 million in personal protective equipment to hospitals fighting the COVID-19 pandemic in black communities, starting his own Operation 42 challenge to encourage others to donate PPE.

                    <br>Boseman was diagnosed with stage III colon cancer in 2016, which eventually progressed to stage IV before 2020. He never spoke publicly about his cancer diagnosis, and according to The Hollywood Reporter, "Only a handful of non-family members knew that Boseman was sick... with varying degrees of knowledge about the severity of [his] condition." During treatment, involving multiple surgeries and chemotherapy, he continued to work and completed production for several films, including Marshall, Da 5 Bloods, Ma Rainey, and others.
                    <br>
                    <br>Boseman died at his Los Angeles home as a result of complications related to colon cancer on August 28, 2020, with his wife and family by his side. He was 43 years old. He died without a will, and his estate will be governed by California law with the representation of Ledward. A public memorial service was held on September 4, 2020, in Anderson, South Carolina, where the speakers included Boseman's childhood pastor as well as Deanna Brown-Thomas, daughter of James Brown, whom Boseman portrayed in Get on Up. The city announced plans for the creation of a permanent art memorial at the service. Despite reports that Boseman was buried at Welfare Baptist Church cemetery in nearby Belton, South Carolina, the funeral home handling the services and the church pastor both denied this.
